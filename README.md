Overall, my summer was not terribly exciting. I spent the majority of my time working at a gas station Taco Bell (it was only slightly more sanitary than you'd expect.) It got stressful at times, but it was all worth it for that sweet, sweet dough. Other than that, any time not spent there, I would be sleeping. Life truly is difficult. Here's hoping this class is a bit more thrilling than the past four months!

I didn't too much over the Summer. I went to a golfing range with my dad early in the Summer. Then most of the remainder of the time, I worked at my job at The Cardinal Gameday Fan Store (most others would know it as T.I.S), and in the evenings, I would spend a bit of time working on my own D&D campaign. At the start of August, I went down and stayed in Gulf Shores for a bit more than a week, and finally after returning, I went to a Get The Led Out concert.
