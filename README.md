Austin Belt
============
Overall, my summer was not terribly exciting. I spent the majority of my time working at a gas station Taco Bell (it was only slightly more sanitary than you'd expect.) It got stressful at times, but it was all worth it for that sweet, sweet dough. Other than that, any time not spent there, I would be sleeping. Life truly is difficult. Here's hoping this class is a bit more thrilling than the past four months!

I didn't really do much over the summer. I pretty much just worked and hung out with my friends. I also played a lot of video games. Recently I've been playing a lot of rocket league.
