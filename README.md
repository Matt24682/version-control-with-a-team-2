Overall, my summer was not terribly exciting. I spent the majority of my time working at a gas station Taco Bell (it was only slightly more sanitary than you'd expect.) It got stressful at times, but it was all worth it for that sweet, sweet dough. Other than that, any time not spent there, I would be sleeping. Life truly is difficult. Here's hoping this class is a bit more thrilling than the past four months!

This past summer I worked for a landscaping business back in my hometown. This was my 3rd and final year working for this landscaping company. When I wasnâ€™t working I spent my free time doing things like, golfing, hanging out with friends and family, going out boating, and kayaking. Luckily with the most of the COVID restrictions being lifted I was able to go to a concert with some friends as well. Overall it was a good summer.
